# CS-360-MobileArchitectureAndProgramming
Third Project and review for CS-360

<p>
  Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
</p>
<p>
  The goal was to produce a weight tracking application. The application was meant to store goal and daily weights and indicate when the user had met their goal weight.
 </p>
<p>
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
</p>
<p>
  The interface design was mostly completed. The design included a settings screen, a screen for entering and editing weights, and a screen for displaying 
  all collected weights.
  The design fulfilled the desire to have a simple intuitive interface. The idea was a lightweight app that fit the requirements.
<p>
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
  </p>
  <p>
  I think of myself as a better than decent coder. To date, I have not been able to translate that to functional Android code. I will keep trying.
  </p>
  <p>
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
  </p>
  <p>
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  </p>
  <p>
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
